Hi everyone! I'm Zhao Zehe, a team member and lead developer. I have a solid background in programming and software development, which allows me to write clean and efficient code. I'm particularly interested in AI and machine learning, and I enjoy applying these technologies to solve real-world problems.
In this project, I'm responsible for the core code development, debugging, and ensuring the stability and performance of our product. I actively collaborate with other team members to address technical challenges and contribute to the overall success of our project.
I'm looking forward to learning and growing with all of you. Let's work together to make this project a success!
